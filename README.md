cats go meow meow
They have cute paws
When they get angry
They bring out their claws

cats play with toys
They make lots of noise...
cats are white
they like to fight

kittens sleep soundly,
they have cute noses,

They scare rats away,
All night all day

They ate my tuna and they sway,
But tigers are better anyway
They have black and orange stripes,
And get lots of likes,
